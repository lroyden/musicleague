You walk into “Betty’s Bar and Grill” in a small town, which looks like it has a capacity of 100+ but there is exactly 8 people in there. You are younger than everyone by at least 20 years. 

At least three of them will stare at you for longer than you’d like them to, but it’s only because you aren’t one of the 1,000 people in their town so they’re just getting a look at ya like the zoo animal you now are

A guy in his 60s with white hair is playing pool against a bald guy with a beard and his sunglasses on the back of his head.

Even though I like a bunch of Jack's Mannequin songs, I have a hard time with his voice, but this song really held my attention and kept me engaged.
