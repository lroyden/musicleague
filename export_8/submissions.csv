As I've shared somewhere in these 32F chats before, I only found this song/artist when when my Youtube homepage showed me that Alex G. performed this song on Colbert.

""Alex G? Wandoff Superstar, Alex G?! That's incredible!"" and gave it a listen.
That lead me to his Tiny Desk, and I've been listening to him ever since.

I absolutely love the lyrics here, you can feel there's so much depth, emotion, and personal history behind each line.

They’ve received a bunch of Grammy nominations/wins within their genre, but this was their only Record of the Year nomination. Well deserved. Just a timeless hit that never gets old.

The crowd goes nuts when Pharrell appears. I just got chills again watching this.
The hype was unreal for this song and album and it somehow surpassed it.

This song is iconic and the Grammys performance (especially relevant for this category) with Nile Rodgers and Stevie Wonder is legendary - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBJMr1v5Zuw
