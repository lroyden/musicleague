And some fun Labyrinth facts because why not:

*The ""Dance Magic"" scene consisted of over 48 puppets, 52 puppeteers, and eight people in goblin costumes

*Michael Jackson, Prince, and Mick Jagger were considered to play Goblin King Jareth. Jim Henson preferred Sting, until his kids convinced him that David Bowie would be best suited to it.",7318c17fa2b24c20a70105f30c1fde47,Yes
