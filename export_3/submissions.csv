There are endless great choices available, but I'll go with Subterranean Homesick Blues because it's a song that is so incredibly both OF its time but also AHEAD of its time. It was Dylan's first hit song and it namechecks the major 60s cultural issues (Vietnam, Civil Rights, drugs, protest, feminism), but it was also one of the first ever music videos (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGxjIBEZvx0) and has been described as ""the first rap song"" because of the nature of the lyrics and speed with which they're delivered.

No less than John Lennon said the song was ""so captivating that he did not know how he would be able to write a song that could compete with it."" If not for Dylan's ever-present harmonica, you could hear this song today and think it contemporary.

but is it fun as hell to shout TELL YOUR BOYFRIEND IF HE SAYS HE’S GOT BEEF, THAT I’M A VEGETARIAN AND I AIN’T FUCKING SCARED OF HIM? Absolutely, put it on repeat. ",7d730e2262674414a7635d741baf9841,Yes

It’s just so cliche, so Murica, so American flag and cowboys boots and not really at all the kind of song I would usually love…

But I love it anyway. It fucking rocks. And just turn it on and listen to it sometimes. And watch the music video. And then put it on again. Sue me!!!",7d730e2262674414a7635d741baf9841,Yes
