You can feel the visceral emotion in the vocals. 

The 1st time I heard this song I cried both because at it's beauty and vulnerability, and how the song put into words and music the inner monolougue of when we're at our most antisocial. It has stuck with me ever since.

""At the foot of the house of cards"" in the chorus is being young and impressionable in the public eye, knowing it can all collapse so easily. The ""wolves"" are fickle fans and taste makers who can turn on you if you don't deliver what they expect from you.
