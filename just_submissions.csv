Keev Biopic Soundtrack,Need a song for the closing credits of a movie about the life of Akiva Wienerkur,Kids,MGMT,Oracular Spectacular,jcrumley,We have heard so many stories of Akiva's youth and of his kids - many from the kids thems lives - that this song felt appropriate. The song itself has a nostalgia that seems appropriate for a biopic. The song has a feeling of connecting the child looking unsure at the world around them and the adult trying to go back to that simpler view of the world
Keev Biopic Soundtrack,Need a song for the closing credits of a movie about the life of Akiva Wienerkur,Creep,Radiohead,Pablo Honey,Alexander Chester,"The vibe of the song screams ""closing credits of a movie"" to me, and the lyrics sound like they're talking about Keev.

""I wish I was special, you're so fuckin' special""

""What the hell am I doin' here? I don't belong here""
~ What Keev thinks whenever he grimaces and says ""oh boy"" after one of Alex's off color comments"

The angsty pop punk vibes feel exactly like Leafs fans.

""Cant find a good reason, Can't find hope to beLEAF in""

""How far will we take this"" applies to their current playoff run.

...funny this song also fits with how everyone must have felt waiting for me to submit."
Sports Anthem,A song that best represents a sports team you root for - explain why,I Won't Back Down,Tom Petty,Full Moon Fever,John Gilpatrick,"This is basically the ethos of the Philadelphia eagles.

I ain't saying you treated me unkind
You could've done better but I don't mind
You just kinda wasted my precious time

Sports Anthem,A song that best represents a sports team you root for - explain why,Keep Holding On,Avril Lavigne,The Best Damn Thing (Expanded Edition),Evan Jean,"Could've gone with a more negative vibe with our history, could've gone with My Girl, could've gone with some Timmy Trumpet, but who doesn't like a little Avril when you need to keep holding onto hope as a Mets fan"
Sports Anthem,A song that best represents a sports team you root for - explain why,Wagon Wheel,Old Crow Medicine Show,O.C.M.S.,Laura Royden,"Because my entire life is running from the cold up in New England, and hoping for Raleigh so I can see my baby (the North Carolina Tar Heels) tonight.

The vocals are stunning and infectious. One of the greatest breakup songs in history.
It's also so wild that it's about the dopey brother from Full House. 
This song is gritty but beautiful, vulgar, yet powerful. 
Absolute banger. Complete bop. This song deserves your vote."

90s Throwback,"What’s the best song of the 90s, however you define that decade - OTHER than Smells Like Teen Spirit",Everlong,Foo Fighters,The Colour And The Shape,keev26,"If you needed an acoustic radio performance in the 1990's (or today), you called the Foo Fighters and they played Everlong. If there was a somber moment (like a TV show ending), you called the Foo Fighters and they played Everlong. You can argue that Dave Grohl was involved in the two best songs of the 1990s."
90s Throwback,"What’s the best song of the 90s, however you define that decade - OTHER than Smells Like Teen Spirit",Semi-Charmed Life,Third Eye Blind,Third Eye Blind,Laura Royden,An absolute banger and the best song about crystal meth you’ll ever hear
90s Throwback,"What’s the best song of the 90s, however you define that decade - OTHER than Smells Like Teen Spirit",Wonderwall,Oasis,(What's The Story) Morning Glory?,Eric Gillen,I could probably pick 200 songs for this round.

90s Throwback,"What’s the best song of the 90s, however you define that decade - OTHER than Smells Like Teen Spirit",My Own Worst Enemy,Lit,A Place In The Sun,Evan Jean,"As a 95 baby, I don't have as much of a memory of a lot songs in the 90s as probably most people in this, but that doesn't mean there aren't bangers from the 90s.

This song came out in 99 so it just made the cut but imo it's one of the best songs from the 90s and it was around a lot when I was a kid in sports and video games and I still love it today."
90s Throwback,"What’s the best song of the 90s, however you define that decade - OTHER than Smells Like Teen Spirit",Santa Monica,Everclear,Sparkle And Fade,jcrumley,"This prompt is impossible. There's no tight answer, but they are plenty of wrong answer (including anything by Celine Dion). I considered going with something by Pearl Jam, but it is too hard to pick an album, much less a song. I went with Everclear, since they did such a great job of capturing the feeling of a being a teenager or 20-something in the 90s . Many other bands did similar things, but I don't think anyone did this better."

It became a real art form during this decade, rising to new heights and deadly consequences. Mo money no problems sums it up. And it’s an absolute banger."
90s Throwback,"What’s the best song of the 90s, however you define that decade - OTHER than Smells Like Teen Spirit",Cut Your Hair,Pavement,"Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain",Adam Cohen,"Almost went with a Beck song, but Pavement was my true gateway into discovering 1990s indie rock, which was a giant part of my personality back then. This maybe isn't their best song, but probably their most iconic.

Stephen Malkmus rules."

Personal Favorite,Lesser known songs you love and want everyone to know about!,Charlie,"Kenneth Pattengale & Joey Ryan, The Milk Carton Kids",Retrospect,mattjstewart17,I love this whole album. These two are super folky with amazing harmonies. This one is my favorite written to the singer’s non-existent future daughter. I also thought fewer than 1M listens on Spotify made it niche enough.

Tried to pick a song that was fast-paced at times while possessing the unique orchestral component.
Personal Favorite,Lesser known songs you love and want everyone to know about!,Turn Your Love,Half Moon Run,Sun Leads Me On,zrichler,"Half moon run, an indie band out of Montreal. Great harmonies, and everyone in the band plays multiple instruments, including the drummer who has a keyboard as part of his kit so he is frequently drumming with his left hand and pedals, while keyboarding with his right. Amazing to see live"

You can feel the visceral emotion in the vocals. 

The 1st time I heard this song I cried both because at it's beauty and vulnerability, and how the song put into words and music the inner monolougue of when we're at our most antisocial. It has stuck with me ever since.

""Why are they staring? Am I oversharing? I'm so embarrassing."" I feel that in my soul.

Probably would have been safer to put a happy positive song. But I felt had to be real. This is my favourite song od the last decade or so."

The drums, the guitar, such a jam. So fun to sing/scream along to. To me, it’s the perfect song for when everything is going wrong and you’re depressed but also you just want to dance and move on, laughing through the pain. A bit of “the best revenge is being happy” energy here too. Who among us hasn’t reached the stage where you just want to have a party? Fuck it!"

Personal Favorite,Lesser known songs you love and want everyone to know about!,The Jeweller's Hands,Arctic Monkeys,Humbug,John Gilpatrick,"This is a top five song from my favorite band, but if you look up their Spotify listens, it's one of the least listened to. It's their third album and after two big hits in the UK they came over to america and were produced in the california desert by queens of the stone age's josh homme. i think album is all about what it's like to be famous and all the worst aspects of that and this song, as the album's last track, brings it home in glorious, almost James-Bond-theme-esque fashion. ""At the foot of the house of cards"" in the chorus is being young and impressionable in the public eye, knowing it can all collapse so easily. The ""wolves"" are fickle fans and taste makers who can turn on you if you don't deliver what they expect from you. And ""the procession of pioneers"" are those who came before AM and succumbed to the trappings of fame. 

Anyway, i think it's a great, haunting song."

This song is fine though. Not a very inspiring comment but I was hoping I'd be able to go with a song from when I was 18 but it seems like some people would vote it down just for that and I'm not looking for the smoke.

Movie Nostalgia,A song that reminds you of a specific movie or movie scene (Bohemian Rhapsody need not apply),Can't Take My Eyes off You,Frankie Valli,The Very Best of Frankie Valli & The 4 Seasons,Alexander Chester,"The first song that jumps to mind is Bitter Sweet Symphony in the climactic scene of Cruel Intentions, a movie I saw so many times in high school. But Gerrit will decide that's too ""basic"" and ""obvious"", so instead I'm gonna go with another movie I saw a million times in high school, which had an iconic song in an iconic scene that, unlike Bitter Sweet Symphony, I wasn't actually aware of until I saw the movie and Heath Ledger sang it to Julia Stiles in Ten Things I Hate About You. At the time the idea of a girl being interested in me was an impossibly foreign concept, but Ledger's singing struck me as the most romantic thing you could do for a girl: Embarrass yourself in front of everyone for her benefit."

Personal Favorite Redux,Another lesser known song that you love - pick a band that no one has submitted yet in any round of this league,Fig in Leather,Devendra Banhart,Ape in Pink Marble,mattjstewart17,"This song is a really weird. I know it has 12M streams so not super niche but I think he’s still pretty niche. This song is one that me and my cousins love but lots of people think it’s so weird. I guess psychedelic folky rock isn’t everybody’s bag. 

The lyrics are really weird but it’s supposed to be from the perspective of a foreign aging person hitting on a younger woman at a Japanese hotel. He even writes the lyrics in broken English. “I’m real high tech, authority that’s right I’m quite an ace…have you seen my carrying case”. It’s silly but catchy."

It was my friend's cousin's band who was together when I was in high school. I thought they were catchy and the songs are still pretty good (very late 90's/early 00's sound).

We Are All Crumley,Song from the 50s or 60s .. let’s say no Beatles,The Weight - Remastered 2000,The Band,Music From Big Pink (Remastered),Abe Sutton,"First of all, the Band is such a boss name for a band.

Second I kind of love this song, it’s one of those songs that you just know somehow, but didn’t really know who sings it or what it’s called.

Finally, ate these lyrics actually about Gerrit’s music league experience? :

“Crazy Chester followed me
And he caught me in the fog
He said, ""I will fix your rack
If you'll take Jack, my dog""
I said, ""Wait a minute, Chester
You know I'm a peaceful man”"
We Are All Crumley,Song from the 50s or 60s .. let’s say no Beatles,Fortunate Son,Creedence Clearwater Revival,Willy And The Poor Boys (Expanded Edition),keev26,"When you hear Fortunate Son in a movie, you know something great is about to happen."
We Are All Crumley,Song from the 50s or 60s .. let’s say no Beatles,Sunny,Bobby Hebb,Sunny,mattjstewart17,1963 song. There are so many options so I went with one that feels a bit less well known (although hard to find a fully deep cut that long ago) but still is a bop. The jazziness of the music and the soulfulness of the singing make it a great listen.
We Are All Crumley,Song from the 50s or 60s .. let’s say no Beatles,Gimme Shelter,The Rolling Stones,Let It Bleed,Laura Royden,My favorite Stones
We Are All Crumley,Song from the 50s or 60s .. let’s say no Beatles,Subterranean Homesick Blues,Bob Dylan,Bringing It All Back Home,Alexander Chester,"Ahh we're finally doing a category focused on the best era in music (the 60s, that is ... the 50s are another story).

There are endless great choices available, but I'll go with Subterranean Homesick Blues because it's a song that is so incredibly both OF its time but also AHEAD of its time. It was Dylan's first hit song and it namechecks the major 60s cultural issues (Vietnam, Civil Rights, drugs, protest, feminism), but it was also one of the first ever music videos (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGxjIBEZvx0) and has been described as ""the first rap song"" because of the nature of the lyrics and speed with which they're delivered.

No less than John Lennon said the song was ""so captivating that he did not know how he would be able to write a song that could compete with it."" If not for Dylan's ever-present harmonica, you could hear this song today and think it contemporary. It also seems fresh because it doesn't suffer from being overplayed like so many cliche classic rock songs."
We Are All Crumley,Song from the 50s or 60s .. let’s say no Beatles,Downtown,Petula Clark,The Ultimate Petula Clark,Beverage,"When I was 16, my dad had a CD with a bunch of old songs, including Downtown, that he would play whenever we went on road trips. In 2000, I despised this song. Now it makes me feel nostalgic."
We Are All Crumley,Song from the 50s or 60s .. let’s say no Beatles,House Of The Rising Sun,The Animals,The Animals,zrichler,"When I was in high school, I worked at a drug store,  and one of my coworkers threw a house party for us. She was a hot blonde who worked in the cosmetic department, and  she was dating one of our other coworkers. Because this was when Napster was everyone's source of music, she spent a good 15 minutes trying to convince me this was a zeppelin song because that's what her mp3 said. Anyways, her boyfriend later found her hooking up with another coworker and put his fist through the mirror while storming out. Good times, the next couple of weeks at work were fun.

That is what I think of now when I hear this (great) song."
We Are All Crumley,Song from the 50s or 60s .. let’s say no Beatles,California Dreamin',The Mamas & The Papas,If You Can Believe Your Eyes And Ears,gerritcoulter,"This is the song I think of for the 60's. Beautiful, ear-wormy, and yet singular. This song is just iconic!"

We Are All Crumley,Song from the 50s or 60s .. let’s say no Beatles,Brown Eyed Girl,Van Morrison,Blowin' Your Mind!,Amir Bednarsh,"This song is absolutely timeless. If it comes on, me, my parents, and my kids would all sing along. It doesn’t feel dated at all, and has a near 100% approval ratings. Perfect for a summer drive, a stadium sing along, chilling in the backyard, a pool playlist, etc. Anything."
We Are All Crumley,Song from the 50s or 60s .. let’s say no Beatles,Kathy's Song,Simon & Garfunkel,Sounds Of Silence,John Gilpatrick,I’m not gonna find a deep cut artist so I’ll go with a very under appreciated track from one of my favorite artists of these decades. I’m not sure if people know this one or not but I think it’s so beautiful.
We Are All Crumley,Song from the 50s or 60s .. let’s say no Beatles,Surfin' Bird,The Trashmen,Surfin' Bird,Allixor,"We need some more OOMA MOW MOW, OOMA OOM OWMAMOW in this group.

We Are All Crumley,Song from the 50s or 60s .. let’s say no Beatles,Dazed and Confused - 1990 Remaster,Led Zeppelin,Led Zeppelin,jcrumley,"Is it cheating a little bit to take an influential song from 1969? Maybe, but they had another album from later in 1969. Plus, it rocks, hard."
We Are All Crumley,Song from the 50s or 60s .. let’s say no Beatles,You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin',The Righteous Brothers,The Very Best Of The Righteous Brothers - Unchained Melody,Eric Gillen,Trump is playing this right now thinking about Elon.
We Are All Crumley,Song from the 50s or 60s .. let’s say no Beatles,I Ain't Marching Anymore,Phil Ochs,Rhino Hi-Five: Phil Ochs,Adam Cohen,I've always thought Phil Ochs was a better protest / anti-war folk singer then Dylan. I wonder if he ever gets mad that no one knows who he is while Dylan is a super mega legend.

It’s just so cliche, so Murica, so American flag and cowboys boots and not really at all the kind of song I would usually love…

For me I unironically love most of his music but it's definitely not my first choice of songs to share with people. And per usual I don't expect a pop song to get a lot of love here but oh well."
Guilty Pleasure,A song you don’t ever admit that you secretly love … what happens in 32 Fans Music League stays.. you know,bad guy,Billie Eilish,"WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO?",jcrumley,"This is a tough category. It is not like I'm 10 and sneaking listening to death metal or 19 and pretending I don't like a pop song.
So,, I went with Billie Eilish. It can be creepy when middle aged guys like young female singers, but it is a good song. I remember Billie doing this song on SNL, my wife being repelled by the performance and fast-forwarding through it. The song still gets thumbs up from me."

From the early 2000s boy band boom, it was far from a hit but the closest they had to a hit. I just think it’s catchy as fuck. Guilty pleasure bc if I told someone I was listening to SoulDecision 20 years later they’d try to commit me. Not even SoulDecisions parents listen to SoulDecision"

That may surprise some, but the scene is just the perfect way to kick off the movie - it catches you up on her childhood while introducing most of the key characters and also previewing the main struggle of the movie (Island vs Ocean). Obviously I also love the song itself and couldn’t help but walk around my house declaring “Make way! Make Way!

The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill is considered one of the greatest albums of all time, and the fact that one of the songs on it is a cover from '67 is pretty surprising.

The result is an amazing album featuring Sheryl Crow, Rufus Wainwright, Eddie Vedder, Ben Harper, The Wallfowers, Aimee Mann, the Black Crowes, Nick Cave, others. 

Can't really go wrong with any of these, but Chester just mentioned Ben Folds, so I'll pick this one, which is beautiful but also should hopefully secure at least his vote."

Under Cover,Pick a cover song thats not as well known as the original song,Mad World,Jasmine Thompson,Mad World,Beverage,Wanted to go Mad World by Gary Jules but probably more well known than Tears For Fears at this point. I'll instead opt for the Jasmine Thompson version which is also really good.
Under Cover,Pick a cover song thats not as well known as the original song,Hey Ya - solo version,Obadiah Parker,The Tip Jar Volume One,Zvi Rapps,"What makes the perfect cover?
A Stone Cold Classic that gets reimagined in a way that leaves you appreciating both versions in separate, but maybe equal ways.

The original song is perfect, and yet, the beautiful acoustic rendition with the soothing dulcet tones of some dude named Obadiah Parker hits in a completely different, but arguably better, way.

So go chop down some firewood, kindle the fireplace, crack open a nice pumpkin IPA, and surrender to this gorgeous Hey Ya cover."

As an added bonus, the lead singer is a comedian as well, and he's absolutely hilarious. So aside from hearing a great concert, you also get some incredible impressions (https://youtube.com/shorts/zfV8qEvS9l0?si=ScYNYnh5sg1m_W4V) and jokes.

Taking this album for example song by song uses things on each song you wouldnt even consider as instruments. This tune dips into classic blues and using his more gravely sound.

I was hooked, but could not find any information on the song.

Eventually I found the Holy Grail - Sun is Out by The Apples in Stereo.

Kesha is brave as hell to have written this about being sexually assaulted and abused by Dr Luke, and dramatically changing her style of music away from what he pushed her into. The bridge is so absurdly good — “some things only God can forgive” and the high note. 

The beauty in the lyrics here are how she’s talking about moving past her assault/abuse without falling into the trap of needing to forgive or excuse her abuser for what he did — that’s between him and God!! There are a lot of fake empowering songs but this one is so genuine.

Inspirational, gorgeous, moving, perfect. The lyrics themselves but also in the context of her still being on Dr Luke’s label makes this a lyrical unicorn for me. So good."

Lynyrd Skynyrd Jones (another exmaple of great storytelling in writing.)

Reason Ive picked Crazyland amung many choices is partially to do with how he described coming up with its idea - to change things up each record he changes enviornment. He rented out a restaurnt in NC for a month in Jan 2020 and wrote and recorded a new song each day. This intentionally added pressure chased creativity to the point it was the only thing he could think of and dreamt the lyrics to this song (about personifying emotions in a bar) woke up and began working on it.

I am not the only traveler
Who has not repaid his debt
I've been searching for a trail to follow again
Take me back to the night we met
And then I can tell myself
What the hell I'm supposed to do
And then I can tell myself
Not to ride along with you
I had all and then most of you
Some and now none of you
Take me back to the night we met
I don't know what I'm supposed to do
Haunted by the ghost of you
Oh, take me back to the night we met
When the night was full of terrors
And your eyes were filled with tears
When you had not touched me yet
Oh, take me back to the night we met
I had all and then most of you
Take me back to the night we met
I don't know what I'm supposed to do
Haunted by the ghost of you
Take me back to the night"

The Silver Jews are definitely super indie and not for everyone. But simply put, Berman (RIP) is one of the best lyricists of our time and the definition of a tortured soul genius artist. He even studied poetry for a masters degree.

A few of my other favorite lyrics of his, not from this song:

""The stars don’t shine upon us, we’re in the way of their light."" 

Robot walks into a bar. Orders a drink, lays down a bill.

Word Up,"Songs with lyrics that stand out to you because they are particularly… funny, poignant, weird, meaningful? Anything works but tell us why",Elderly Woman Behind the Counter in a Small Town - Remastered,Pearl Jam,Vs.,Zvi Rapps,"I'm new here, do people like Pearl Jam?

This is far and away my favorite PJ song, and one of my favorites all time. 
A big reason for that is the lyrics. 
There's something instantly relatable, understandable, and moving about this short story that Eddie Vedder is singing about.
In fact, one of the first times I heard this song, I felt the same way about it as Vedder describes in the second line:
""Haunting familiar, yet I can't seem to place it""

In Vedder's words:
""It’s kind of about a lady, and she’s getting on in years, and she’s stuck in this small town. Small towns fascinate me: You either struggle like hell to get out, to some people want to stay ‘cause then they’re the big fish in the small pond, and then others just kind of get stuck there.""

And then (I'm paraphrasing b/c of character limit), what happens when the elderly lady who's been stuck there sees an old flame who's passing back through town - but she's too embarrassed to even say hello.
Hauntingly beautiful.

With daily national protests going on, in these times of polarization, xenophobia, and fights over the border and who belongs in the US, I find myself constantly thinking about this song from The Hamilton Mixtape. It's based off of the line from the show - ""Immigrants, we get the job done"", and then it becomes more than a song — it turns into an anthem that reclaims the immigrant story as America's true identity. This song oozes with pride & confidence.

The artists here are themselves either immigrants or children of immigrants. Each brings their own cultural style story, creating an incredible melting pot of a rap song.

Simply Iconic.

Between the two I'm going with this one because I respect women. Look, are the lyrics misogynist? It's Tupac. It's 90s rap. So yes. But it's still poignant and tragic.

Radiohead had this album online as a ""pay what you want""; I think high school me payed $3. Best money I ever spent.
Only 10 songs on the main album, and they're all bangers, so it was tough to pick.
But went with Jigsaw Falling into Place because for probably at least 5 years, it was my favourite song period.

My music listening can definitely be divided into 2 eras, pre-In Rainbows and post. Gone were the days of Bon Jovi and Guns n Roses (not saying they're bad, but they didn't hit the same after).
So hopefully you all enjoy this one even a little bit as much as I did then and do now"

Best thing about the show was that Marc, the lead singer, lost his voice, so it ended up just being about an hour and a half of Jerry the saxophonist ripping solos. 

I didn't know their music then, which is what makes it funny as my first concert, but the fact that I stuck around and have listened to them since is a testament to their music.

I almost certainly just wanted to own the mega-hit Stacey's Mom, but now wallowing in a recently post-Napsterized world, that meant buying the whole album from Barnes & Noble.

From the first chords of the first song, this album is a nearly perfect 16-song journey that blew my mind and still holds up to this day.
Even now, I put on Mexican Wine to consider submitting it, and listened to almost the whole album straight through.

Now, imagine this musically hip 11 year old buying this random band's album just for the MILF song of the year, only to discover that they have an entire gorgeous ballad about growing up in Hackensack, NJ, the very town over from my own!? This instantly became the thing I told everyone in my school about. I was that cool.

I had to commit forgery on the order form to get this album too because my parents forbid any albums with an explicit content label.

The Fugees absolutely blew my mind when I first heard them, and I would play this song on repeat. The smooth and soulful hip hop style of Wyclef / Pras mixed with Lauryn Hill’s soulful vocals was a combination that turned me into the music fan I am today."

Pride Month,Celebrate pride any way you’d like!,Sofia,Clairo,Immunity,Amir Bednarsh,"Sofia does a great job capturing the feelings of a  crush, with a sweet mix of  lo-fi vibes and dreamy vocals. It celebrates being queer in a pure and simple way, delivered in a classic indie pop style.

Clairo has explained that ""Sofia"" was inspired by her first experiences having crushes on older women whom she saw in the media, namely Sofia Vergara. She explained that “instead of hiding it, it's expressed in an almost 'explosive' manner""."
Pride Month,Celebrate pride any way you’d like!,Pretty Girls,Reneé Rapp,Snow Angel,Laura Royden,"Renee is our lesbian queen. She’s purposefully messy in a way that Chappell aspires to be imo. Amazing situation where she once called out this sexist guy Buddy who owns a bus company, look it up. lo

She came out as a lesbian instead of bisexual during the tour for this, which led to a fun dynamic where she would sing “yeah your boyfriend’s cute” and then everyone would shoot with her NO HE’S NOT! and then she would sing “yeah he can come too” and everyone would shout NO HE CAN’T!

Anyway it’s really cool and fun that we have a normal hot girl pop star who loves being a lesbian and loves women and centers them in her life.

It's a beautiful love song written by Frank Ocean about his first love being a man.
This song was Frank Ocean confirming rumors/coming out as bisexual, and the lyrics are full of sarcastic, flirty, obvious ""lies"", hinting at his obvious crush on this man.
The falsettos are gorgeous, too. I could listen to this all day.

(I was curious what the reaction was to an up-and-coming hip-hop artist coming out and it seems to have been very positive, inspiring Russell Simmons to write:
""Today is a big day for hip-hop. It is a day that will define who we really are. How compassionate will we be? How loving can we be? How inclusive are we? 
Your decision to go public about your sexual orientation gives hope and light to so many young people still living in fear."")

However, this song was the 1st song written by their guitarist Leandra Earl, about a fight with her serious girlfriend (at the time) which ended up actually leading to their breakup. Her and her ex and their families are still super close.
Vote for this song because it fucking rules."

Can't actually find anything to confirm sexuality, but it's an all female punk band out of Montreal, with their first album (which just beat sum 41 for the best rock album juno) called set your pussy free, so I assume they are all gay, which I believe this Instragram post is hinting at (https://www.instagram.com/reel/DKahoaBTxtx/?igsh=MW4zajk3cGRxeTZtZQ==). What do you think Laura, all gay?"

I am not here to debate the gayness of Chicago as a city, that was for last round.

It starts off beautifully, slow and haunting, and then right before the chorus, it has that guitar riff that’s the musical equivalent of a ticking time bomb. It picks up with a chorus that explodes with emotion and power. And then at the end you get the big moment where Steven Tyler does what only Steven Tyler can do. Chills every time.

Vienna is my favourite Billy Joel song and still so relatable almost 40 years later.

Penal Code offenses in ""The LBC"" listed below:

""Some brothas shootin' dice, so I said, 'Let's do this'""- Violation of PC Section 330: Illegal gaming in California.

""Some brothas pulled some gats, so I said, 'I'm stuck'""- A clear act of PC 211: Robbery as the men rob Warren G by force, and while not an additional crime, in his hometown.

""Nate Dogg is about to make some bodies turn cold."" - Nate Dogg is guilty of PC 187: Murder when he has to regulate. There is an argument that Nate Dogg is coming to defense of Warren G under PC 197 if the use of force exerted by Nate Dogg was proportional to the force exerted by the robbers.

California Health and Safety Code [Section] 11357 (a) –(d) – Possession of Marijuana: We can reasonably assume Nate Dogg is over the 28.5 gram limit as he states, ""If you smoke like I smoke, then you're high like everyday."""

Gord and the boys deliver a great rock song as usual

""The first single from the Hip's Fully Completely tells the tale of abduction and murder of Quebec Minister of Labour Pierre Laporte by the FLQ in 1970, told from the killer's point of view. The event, now known as the October Crisis, lead Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau to infamously enact the War Measure Act, suspending all civil liberties in one of the only three times it's ever been used in history. Laporte's body was eventually found in the trunk of the car used by his kidnappers after they tipped off a Montreal radio station. Like Lady Macbeth, who is unable to wash the imaginary blood of the slain King Duncan off her hands (""Out, damned spot!""), Downie's protagonist is absorbed by guilt and forced to relive the event over and over."""

And for those stickler lawyers out there - there are other crimes in the song that qualify. Racial profiling for one, but also there’s no way strong arming a ho can be legal. And whatever he’s doing when he “gets to clappin” also sounds somewhat suspect.

Somehow it pulls off pairing a feel good, cool, indie-pop vibe with disturbing lyrics about a school shooter. The contrast between the radio friendly beat and the violent story it tells makes the song hit so differently compared to other crime related songs. That dichotomy is a sad and powerful commentary on how normalized school shootings have become in American culture."

If describing events of the holocaust isn’t a crime then I don’t know what to tell you. This is another Scrubs song as well so I’m connecting this round, tv round, and meaningful lyrics all in a less popular genre. 🤷‍♂️, let’s have some fun!

The reference to crime in the lyrics (""I moved out and started really hangin', I needed money of my own, so I started slangin', I ain't guilty, 'cause even though I sell rocks, it feels good puttin' money in your mailbox"") makes you feel just how much he loves and appreciates his mother for battling to get him through his childhood and to where he is in life, and is quite divergent from what you typically see from rappers when they reference crime in their lyrics.

I was mesmerized the first time I heard Maisie Peters's voice, it's truly one of a kind in pop music and deserves so much appreciation.

They have a fairly small, but dedicated fan base. Highly recommended in general. I chose this specific song because it speaks to their vibe as a band who are pretty chill, like to hang out, and don’t take themselves too seriously in general, but it’s also upbeat with a ton of soul. I also think the concept of “do you want to do nothing with me” captures what relationships are really all about.

If you like this, go down the rabbit hole (including live sessions on youtube). I’ve seen them in concert, and they deliver bigtime."

"Hit the Road, Jack",Best songs for a road trip or long drive. Happy Canada Day everyone,Tell The World,Eric Hutchinson,Pure Fiction,Amir Bednarsh,"I discovered this song randomly, and it's got such a perfect road trip song beat and energy to it. The rhythm and piano make it feel like the start of on a joyous adventure. The kick drum keeps the beat, the chorus brings the energy, and then you get the horns. And at 1:45, the music drops out, you get just a beat, and it finishes strong."

This song went huge on tiktok, so I feel most people will probably know it, and it’s just a really good song. In a way the sound feels nostalgic which fits which feels kind of road trip-y."

It's catchy, high energy, and has an easy to sing chorus with fun verses in between. 

I believe the kids these days would refer to this a bop, a banger, a certified goddamn hit."
"Hit the Road, Jack",Best songs for a road trip or long drive. Happy Canada Day everyone,Take Flight,thebandfriday,Take Flight,keev26,"The song title is Take Flight, but it's a road trip song....about road trips:

We took the car out front into the night
Felt like our hearts were touching the sky
We put the windows down and take flight
It felt right
We hit the road out west without sight"
"Hit the Road, Jack",Best songs for a road trip or long drive. Happy Canada Day everyone,Arabella,Arctic Monkeys,AM,John Gilpatrick,"This song slaps and has a killer guitar solo. It also explicitly talks about a beautiful woman riding shotgun and how the sunset you’re driving into can’t match her beauty, so I think it checks multiple road trip boxes. 

Also this is not Gilpy for the record"

Juna exemplifies all that beauty and then some. The horn and synth break at the end is such a unique stylistic choice that only Clairo could pull off among all modern artists. Great song that deserves some love!

When Hozier and Mavis harmonize, I get chills. I love the way he passes her the lead when she comes in and fades very effectively into the background of the song. Just a stellar vocal performance from both."
Who’s that girl?,Songs with a woman’s name in the title,Ana Ng,They Might Be Giants,Lincoln,Zvi Rapps,"This song's not necessarily in a genre that's come up a ton in this league, but I gotta stay true to how much I've always loved this song.

The lyrics in the chorus always stuck with me too:
Ana Ng and I are getting old
And we still haven't walked
In the glow of each other's majestic presence

I had at least a dozen other songs shortlisted for this category, maybe more than any other, so I'm curious to see how many of them make an appearance.

Who’s that girl?,Songs with a woman’s name in the title,Carolina Blues,Blues Traveler,Straight On Till Morning,Zach Brooks,It's such a a good bluesy rock jam. Blues Traveler has a ton of good stuff outside of their hits. According to the lyrics Carolina is referring to a woman not a state.
Who’s that girl?,Songs with a woman’s name in the title,Georgia,Vance Joy,Dream Your Life Away (Deluxe Edition),mattjstewart17,This round smells danger because I’ve changed my song a bunch of times.

Who’s that girl?,Songs with a woman’s name in the title,Kate McCannon,Colter Wall,Colter Wall,keev26,"I'll give you a first and last name here.

This song is pretty unique- the singer tells a complete story that could be a novel in 4.5 minutes, telling you that he's in jail and then explaining why. 

But the showstopper here is Colter's voice. If I gave you 50 guesses, you might not have guessed that he was a 22-year-old kid from Canada when he wrote this song. Truly has one of the coolest voices in the game."

A lot of things are bad in America, but we live on and dance and take shots and have joy! Gotta take the good with the bad sometimes. It’s sort of a good reminder of the diversity of experiences and how broad America is and the beauty in our subcultures despite the negativity. Also it’s a banger and kills at all celebrations."

It’s about a person who moves from Georgia to San Francisco - more than 2000 miles - in search of something only to find he’s most free when he’s doing something as simple as watching the tide. 

Of course Redding is also one of the great American musicians who would die tragically days after recording the track.

I feel the love. C'mon, c'mon, let's start it up” was written as a call to embrace the culture of the 1967 “summer of love” in San Francisco.  I love the overall vibes here, capturing that California energy and warmth that took over America in the 60s. Perfect music for a summer BBQ, chilling at the beach, or a road trip."

Both verses also reference some classic locations in the US. Brooks & Dunn have a very distinct classic country sound, and the key change toward the end of the song is awesome.

Stelth is a guitarist and pianist that yours with the lumineers (and he’s the best part of Lumineers shows as he will play basically every instrument during the performance) but does his own stuff that’s much less popular but more fun and interesting folky music (I know more folk). I went with this one that’s got a bit more mass appeal than some of his 5 minute songs that change tempo midway.

I like the pace of this one and the seasonal theming and imagery throughout the song."

And the reason is, I just want to share this unknown gem with everyone.

Forget about millions of streams - we're talking sub-3,000!? By a band that has 71 monthly listeners, was founded in Texas in the late 90s and disbanded 13 years ago, has no wikipedia page, and barely has an online presence?! 

Hearing this song for the first time it felt like I was transported to SPAC, Deer Creek, Alpine Valley, or Red Rocks in the late 90s/early 2000s.

It's got a great jam band vibe with a soaring guitar solo at the end. But what makes it a perfect submission for this round is how genuinely unknown this song is.

When it came out we all got together and listened to the album, and this song immediately stuck out to me for its melancholy beauty and storytelling. The piano backing mixed with the horn works so well for me. It's only got about 3,100 streams but deserves far more.

I wanted to pay homage to Busta Rhymes this  round. In his prime he had a string of high-energy, action-packed music videos with a bit of humor sprinkled in.

Maybe Hype Williams deserves the most credit as the director of these videos, but Busta was a tremendous entertainer.

The glow in the dark paint in “Put your hands where my eyes can see” is one of his more iconic music video moments."

Love how it's sort of a reference to how her life has become much more publicized since she's become famous.

On this year there was a wicked Florida storm so bad we had to evacuate the fest multiple times (not to mention the hassle I had flying there). Once Sunday came Kenny came on stage 1/2 hr early, anticipating bad weather later on. The theatrics of this performance was amazing as there was lightning going off from every corner of the sky. It was eventually cut short and a huge shower came. We were on way back to Airbnb but just as we got back we got a text saying hes coming back on stage at 10pm. I was the only one of our group who decided to return. To which this bonus hour was the best live concert Ive ever seen.

I wanted a short and sweet one to give a respite amongst the inevitable longer selections.

What amazes me about this track is the crowd. I assume they have no idea who Paula Fuga is (I have never heard of her outside of this one song) but he brings her out to debut her song.

You can hear when she comes out, it sounds like there's a handful of people there. Nobody knows who she is.

She starts strumming on a uke, and Jack joins on guitar.
And then she opens her mouth and the place erupts. (And again at the end of the song).

Gives me chills every time.  

The song itself is gorgeous, with perfect backs and forths and harmonies, it's also a meditation on prayer, a relationship with God, history, the Earth and more.

And most of all, it features an incredible whistle solo/duet that I'd hold up against any guitar solos put up here.

This one though if another story - a classic through and through and one I love listening to every time. The live acoustic performance transforms this track Into a new song altogether - a spellbinding and soulful anthem that just pulls you in and completely redefines the song.

This version is a reinterpretation that gives the song new life."

Miami 2017 is my favorite Billy Joel song. It's a story describing a post apocalyptic NY, and the juxtaposition of the lyrics with the energy of the song is something I've always enjoyed. I was fortunate to hear him play it in person 2 summers ago and had such a great time. 

Also sandwiching the song between two beautiful piano solos that make you pause and say Damn he's really playing that live??? Adds to my appreciation of the track."

I love a live song that strips down all music production elements and just lets a singer sing with a simple backing band. Katy gets to show off some great vocals here, something that she sadly doesn't come close to doing anymore."

This episode is widely regarded as one of the series best, and it’s iconic use of this song is a major reason why. It doesn’t just set the mood, but it captures the heart of this incredible episode. As this song plays out their love story, the typically bleak Black Mirror gets an amazing episode that ends with a rare truly happy ending.

*SPOILER ALERT* - The episode shows a beautiful love story, which turns out to be a simulated afterlife where older or sick people can upload their consciousness and live forever in an incredible digital afterlife. For Yorkie and Kelly, their heaven is literally this digital 80’s world where they finally found love after a lifetime of difficulty and loss.

This was used in a scene in the second season with Rue biking down the street high and spotting Cassie and Nate getting into a car together and then Maddy proceeding to call them both starting to get suspicious about what’s going on there (apt for this week of cheating in the news). 

I love the vibe of the song. The bass line carrying you through and the guitar melody jazzily flowing along the vocals. Not sure if this will play well in here on a single listen but after hearing this in the show I had it on repeat for weeks. The dreamy, jazzy feel meshes so well with the euphoric highs Rue has throughout the show while still having some sinister about it (like the drug use).

Got me curious so I checked it out, and wow.

Some songs take years to become iconic. Others become iconic the moment you first hear them.

That was this song for me. Completely took my breath away and got me immediately into Phoebe Bridgers.
Her tiny desk and red rocks performances of this song are incredible.

I also love that it's a song that the character plays in the show, specifically because it's sad as hell and he needs to cry.

I find the song super emotional, with an insane crescendo, cathartic scream, and even a post-intense song cool down period.
A perfect song in my opinion.

(I of course paid what I  wanted, which was $0 for the download, but loved it so much that I bought a physical CD the same weekend.)

“A Moment Apart” came out in 2017 (on 9/8) and was big step in them “elevating” their sound. One of the biggest highlights of the albums comes in on Track 7 with Leon Bridge, one of the “biggest” artists they have ever collabed with.

A woman once told me that Jenny Lewis is the real patron saint of depressed women in their 20s (I wouldn’t know since I’m a man).

As I've shared somewhere in these 32F chats before, I only found this song/artist when when my Youtube homepage showed me that Alex G. performed this song on Colbert.

""Alex G? Wandoff Superstar, Alex G?! That's incredible!"" and gave it a listen.
That lead me to his Tiny Desk, and I've been listening to him ever since.

I absolutely love the lyrics here, you can feel there's so much depth, emotion, and personal history behind each line.

I was actually surprised to see them nominated amongst the other hits of 2013 (Taylor and Fun. and Kelly Clarkson etc). This song is 3 minutes of pure perfection and swagger. It hooks you instantly with that killer guitar riff. It locks you in and doesn’t let go.

They’ve received a bunch of Grammy nominations/wins within their genre, but this was their only Record of the Year nomination. Well deserved. Just a timeless hit that never gets old.

Though songs like Last Friday Night, California Gurls, and Firework get more buzz, The One That Got Away best represents that era of pop to me. Gotta show some respect to the future First Lady of Canada."
Name Drop it like it’s Hot,"Song mentions another musical artist in the lyrics (who is not involved in the making of the song). Nicknames  are fine (eg, “Pac).”",Wave,Remi Wolf,Big Ideas,John Barber,"""Listening to Timberlake without you, it doesn't scratch the same itch""

Remi Wolf is insanely talented and insanely fun. Her most recent album skewed more serious, this song included about being long distance, but I highly recommend checking out some her songs off her 2021 album Juno if you want to know a bit more about her."
