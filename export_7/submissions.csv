I wanted a short and sweet one to give a respite amongst the inevitable longer selections.

What amazes me about this track is the crowd. I assume they have no idea who Paula Fuga is (I have never heard of her outside of this one song) but he brings her out to debut her song.

You can hear when she comes out, it sounds like there's a handful of people there. Nobody knows who she is.

She starts strumming on a uke, and Jack joins on guitar.
And then she opens her mouth and the place erupts. (And again at the end of the song).

Gives me chills every time.  

The song itself is gorgeous, with perfect backs and forths and harmonies, it's also a meditation on prayer, a relationship with God, history, the Earth and more.

And most of all, it features an incredible whistle solo/duet that I'd hold up against any guitar solos put up here.

Her tiny desk and red rocks performances of this song are incredible.

This was used in a scene in the second season with Rue biking down the street high and spotting Cassie and Nate getting into a car together and then Maddy proceeding to call them both starting to get suspicious about what’s going on there (apt for this week of cheating in the news). 

I love the vibe of the song. The bass line carrying you through and the guitar melody jazzily flowing along the vocals. Not sure if this will play well in here on a single listen but after hearing this in the show I had it on repeat for weeks.

*SPOILER ALERT* - The episode shows a beautiful love story, which turns out to be a simulated afterlife where older or sick people can upload their consciousness and live forever in an incredible digital afterlife.

When I was trying to think off the top of my head of albums, this was really the only one I was sure of - it was so instrumental in my life when it came out.

(I of course paid what I  wanted, which was $0 for the download, but loved it so much that I bought a physical CD the same weekend.)

Lucky for me, my favorite song on that album is also track #7.

The drum part on this alone is legendary, and the vocals are hauntingly beautiful.
