This is far and away my favorite PJ song, and one of my favorites all time. 
A big reason for that is the lyrics. 
There's something instantly relatable, understandable, and moving about this short story that Eddie Vedder is singing about.
In fact, one of the first times I heard this song, I felt the same way about it as Vedder describes in the second line:
""Haunting familiar, yet I can't seem to place it""

In Vedder's words:
""It‚Äôs kind of about a lady, and she‚Äôs getting on in years, and she‚Äôs stuck in this small town. Small towns fascinate me: You either struggle like hell to get out, to some people want to stay ‚Äòcause then they‚Äôre the big fish in the small pond, and then others just kind of get stuck there.""

And then (I'm paraphrasing b/c of character limit), what happens when the elderly lady who's been stuck there sees an old flame who's passing back through town - but she's too embarrassed to even say hello.
Hauntingly beautiful.

Lynyrd Skynyrd Jones (another exmaple of great storytelling in writing.)

Reason Ive picked Crazyland amung many choices is partially to do with how he described coming up with its idea - to change things up each record he changes enviornment. He rented out a restaurnt in NC for a month in Jan 2020 and wrote and recorded a new song each day. This intentionally added pressure chased creativity to the point it was the only thing he could think of and dreamt the lyrics to this song (about personifying emotions in a bar) woke up and began working on it.

The Night We Met is clearly a song about a failed love. Great melody, haunting lyrics, which I'll post below:

I am not the only traveler
Who has not repaid his debt
I've been searching for a trail to follow again
Take me back to the night we met
And then I can tell myself
What the hell I'm supposed to do
And then I can tell myself
Not to ride along with you
I had all and then most of you
Some and now none of you
Take me back to the night we met
I don't know what I'm supposed to do
Haunted by the ghost of you
Oh, take me back to the night we met
When the night was full of terrors
And your eyes were filled with tears
When you had not touched me yet
Oh, take me back to the night we met
I had all and then most of you
Take me back to the night we met
I don't know what I'm supposed to do
Haunted by the ghost of you
Take me back to the night",7d4f28ec1d9e43c3acbb17d9448a7e97,Yes

The Silver Jews are definitely super indie and not for everyone. But simply put, Berman (RIP) is one of the best lyricists of our time and the definition of a tortured soul genius artist. He even studied poetry for a masters degree.

A few of my other favorite lyrics of his, not from this song:

""The stars don‚Äôt shine upon us, we‚Äôre in the way of their light."" 

Robot walks into a bar. Orders a drink, lays down a bill. 
Bartender says, ‚ÄúHey, we don‚Äôt serve robots‚Äù And the robot says, ‚ÄúOh, but someday you will‚Äù

We got the afternoon
You got this room for two
One thing I've left to do
Discover me
Discovering you

And if you want love
We'll make it
Swim in a deep sea
Of blankets
Take all your big plans
And break 'em

I've considered dozens, if not hundreds, of other Rap songs, but I just kept coming back to this. 
The Kendall Roy flow. Squiggle cookin' up the beat. It's a dramaturgical, lyrically surgical, Pyrometallurgical ode to a Shaper of views and Creator of news.

Simply Iconic.

The truth is, I almost submitted this song for basically every category - 

- Under 5 million listens? check.
- (Should have) over a billion? Easy.
- Meaningful lyrics? Check these out:
""Handmade suits, raking in loot
Five-star general, y'all best salute
Yo, bitches be catty, but the King Kong daddy
Rock all the haters while we go roll a fatty""

And how bout this:
""A-1 ratings, 80K wine

Bro, don't get it twisted, I've been through hell
But since I stan dad, I'm alive and well""

With daily national protests going on, in these times of polarization, xenophobia, and fights over the border and who belongs in the US, I find myself constantly thinking about this song from The Hamilton Mixtape. It's based off of the line from the show - ""Immigrants, we get the job done"", and then it becomes more than a song ‚Äî it turns into an anthem that reclaims the immigrant story as America's true identity. This song oozes with pride & confidence.

The artists here are themselves either immigrants or children of immigrants. Each brings their own cultural style story, creating an incredible melting pot of a rap song.

Between the two I'm going with this one because I respect women. Look, are the lyrics misogynist? It's Tupac. It's 90s rap. So yes. But it's still poignant and tragic.
