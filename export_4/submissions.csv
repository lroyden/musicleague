I first heard this song on a commercial in 2007, back in the days before Shazam, before ChatGPT, when I would try and quickly write down the lyrics the best I remembered them and Google until I could figure it out. 
I was hooked, but could not find any information on the song.

Eventually I found the Holy Grail - Sun is Out by The Apples in Stereo.
 
This has been on my #1 playlist for a decade, I would have thought it easily cleared 5 million hits, but I guess not enough of us Googled the lyrics from a Dodge Journey ad (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTdWV3HLk4g)

Taking this album for example song by song uses things on each song you wouldnt even consider as instruments. This tune dips into classic blues and using his more gravely sound. Most of Tom Waits music is an acquired taste as every song is very different to the last, it is hard to classify a generic genre with him.

It builds up slowly in a pretty masterful way, and by the end, it's an all out jam. The harmonies are absolutely perfect.

As an added bonus, the lead singer is a comedian as well, and he's absolutely hilarious. So aside from hearing a great concert, you also get some incredible impressions (https://youtube.com/shorts/zfV8qEvS9l0?si=ScYNYnh5sg1m_W4V) and jokes.
