I went through 3 or 4 different songs (Casualty, More, Don't Lose Sight, Misty Morning) before settling on my personal favorite, the Live in SF version of So Damn Fast .

This was the original comment I included, funny how similar it is to yours:

Curious if anyone else is a fan of Lawrence. 
I was lucky that my close friend was this brother/sister duo and their band's first manager about a decade ago and told me about them. They've since moved on to way bigger things, Gracie was just nominated for a tony and is in sex lives of college girls.
They're both massive Mets fans and seem to perform something at least once or twice a season, which is fun too.

Gracie's voice is insane, the music is great, they've got lots of fun, funky songs, but this one is one of my favorites.
