Radiohead had this album online as a ""pay what you want""; I think high school me payed $3. Best money I ever spent.
Only 10 songs on the main album, and they're all bangers, so it was tough to pick.
But went with Jigsaw Falling into Place because for probably at least 5 years, it was my favourite song period.

My music listening can definitely be divided into 2 eras, pre-In Rainbows and post. Gone were the days of Bon Jovi and Guns n Roses (not saying they're bad, but they didn't hit the same after).
So hopefully you all enjoy this one even a little bit as much as I did then and do now",33fd459ae0b249a68d77459cee2dd4b7,Yes

Best thing about the show was that Marc, the lead singer, lost his voice, so it ended up just being about an hour and a half of Jerry the saxophonist ripping solos. 

I didn't know their music then, which is what makes it funny as my first concert, but the fact that I stuck around and have listened to them since is a testament to their music. 

This song still gives me chills if I haven't heard it in a bit.",33fd459ae0b249a68d77459cee2dd4b7,Yes

I almost certainly just wanted to own the mega-hit Stacey's Mom, but now wallowing in a recently post-Napsterized world, that meant buying the whole album from Barnes & Noble.

From the first chords of the first song, this album is a nearly perfect 16-song journey that blew my mind and still holds up to this day.
Even now, I put on Mexican Wine to consider submitting it, and listened to almost the whole album straight through.

Now, imagine this musically hip 11 year old buying this random band's album just for the MILF song of the year, only to discover that they have an entire gorgeous ballad about growing up in Hackensack, NJ, the very town over from my own!? This instantly became the thing I told everyone in my school about. I was that cool.

""Some brothas pulled some gats, so I said, 'I'm stuck'""- A clear act of PC 211: Robbery as the men rob Warren G by force, and while not an additional crime, in his hometown.

""Nate Dogg is about to make some bodies turn cold."" - Nate Dogg is guilty of PC 187: Murder when he has to regulate. There is an argument that Nate Dogg is coming to defense of Warren G under PC 197 if the use of force exerted by Nate Dogg was proportional to the force exerted by the robbers.

California Health and Safety Code [Section] 11357 (a) –(d) – Possession of Marijuana: We can reasonably assume Nate Dogg is over the 28.5 gram limit as he states, ""If you smoke like I smoke, then you're high like everyday.""",7082443f245a454aba223aabb76c2215,Yes
